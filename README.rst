 `Radula` -- Tools for distributed benchmarking of Ceph
=======================================================

These are a set of tools being developed to help reduce the amount of work
needed when interactively running distributed benchmarks or tests of ceph.
Eventually the goal is to make it easy to launch benchmarks on multiple
machines, grab the results, and parse them into a database for later viewing.
